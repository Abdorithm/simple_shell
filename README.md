# simple_shell
A simple UNIX command interpreter. An immitation of the fantastic Bourne-again SHell a.k.a <code>bash</code>. I can't find a suitable name for my shell. Every Unix shell out there is named some words ending with the word "shell", like <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code> which stands for Z shell.

For my purposes, this shell is named <code>gcsh</code>, GigaChad shell.

ALX Africa gave me the opportunity to work on this project during studying in their sorfware engineering program.
